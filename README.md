What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I would describe at two fold, firstly it was to find the most efficent way to sort and seperate data from a file. Then after solving that problem in giving the time complexity we were to actually implement the functional sorting algorithim into our code.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by making different time complexity charts for each data strucutre. The parts of our menu all had different time complexity and identifiyign the core fucntions of our process was really important. 
The ability to understand how these data strucutres evaluate is so important and a crucial part of our codes success. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When met with a roadblock I hit the books, online resources like zybooks or geeks for geeks provide a plethera of examples to refer too. A lot of these algorithims are very complicated and fire on multiples axis, when you're stuck its important as a developer to know how to look for information that can help you push further. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I've never dealt with such complex theory in code. It was a very introsepctive experience where I felt the phrase 'standing on the shoulders of giants' to have these complicated functions simplified so much to be easily understand and evaluate was surreal. My biggest take away from this is how important it is to use all your resources in development, to succeed and expand we have to use all we have avaliable. There's no sense in reprogramming every api from scratch. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
With how complicated some of the core processes of this code was I spent a lot more time on my documentation. I needed to make much more descript comments in key spots to allow myself to easily refer back to this, I think working on a team would cause similar needs and only elavate my ability to make clear consice code.
